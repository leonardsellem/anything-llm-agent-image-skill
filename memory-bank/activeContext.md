# Active Context

*   **Current Focus:** Finalizing the initial documentation phase by updating all memory-bank files based on the project brief and provided documentation (`documentation/` folder).
*   **Recent Changes:** Updated `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, and `systemPatterns.md` with detailed information extracted from the source documents.
*   **Next Steps:**
    1.  Update this file (`activeContext.md`).
    2.  Update `progress.md`.
    3.  Begin scaffolding the actual skill code:
        *   Create the skill directory (e.g., `openai-image-generation`).
        *   Create `plugin.json` with parameters, examples, and metadata.
        *   Create `handler.js` with basic structure and OpenAI client initialization.
        *   Create `README.md`.
        *   Initialize `package.json` (if needed for dependencies like `openai` or `dotenv`).
        *   Set up basic unit tests with Jest.
*   **Active Decisions:**
    *   Confirmed the plan to update all memory bank files before starting code implementation.
    *   Decided to use `gpt-image-1` as the primary model.
    *   Will return images as base64 strings from the handler.
    *   The skill will support Generations and Edits (including inpainting via mask). Variations endpoint (DALL-E 2 only) might be lower priority or omitted if complex to integrate cleanly.
*   **Key Patterns/Preferences:**
    *   Adhere strictly to AnythingLLM custom skill structure (`hubId` folder, `plugin.json`, `handler.js`).
    *   Use the official OpenAI Node.js SDK.
    *   Prioritize clear error handling and messaging back to the agent.
    *   Employ parameter validation (potentially using a library like `zod` later if complexity increases).
*   **Learnings/Insights:**
    *   AnythingLLM skills have a strict requirement for the handler function to return a string.
    *   The `plugin.json` is crucial for defining the skill's interface to the LLM, including parameters and examples (few-shot prompting).
    *   Hot-loading simplifies the development feedback loop.
    *   OpenAI `gpt-image-1` offers advanced capabilities like editing and inpainting, but also has specific requirements (e.g., mask format).
