# Progress Tracker

*   **Completed Features:**
    *   Project brief defined and documented (`projectbrief.md`).
    *   Analysis of AnythingLLM skill development docs and OpenAI Image API docs completed.
    *   All memory bank files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated with initial project context and requirements (as of 2025-04-24).
    *   **Scaffolding:**
        *   Created skill directory (`openai-image-generation`).
        *   Created `plugin.json` with parameters, metadata, and examples.
        *   Created initial `handler.js` structure.
        *   Created `README.md`.
        *   Initialized `package.json` and installed dependencies.
        *   Set up Jest for testing.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Implemented OpenAI client initialization in `handler.js`.
        *   Implemented logic for `images.generate` endpoint.
        *   Implemented logic for `images.edit` endpoint (including mask handling).
        *   Implemented logic for `images.variation` endpoint.
        *   Implemented parameter validation.
        *   Implemented error handling and formatting.
        *   Converted `handler.js` to CommonJS module (per AnythingLLM requirements).
        *   Fixed `plugin.json` schema issues (removed invalid "required" boolean).
        *   Switched from returning base64 strings to saving images to files (to avoid token limits).
        *   Added example responses in plugin.json to guide the LLM.
        *   Fixed babel.config.js to use CommonJS exports.
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Written unit tests for `handler.js` (mocking OpenAI calls).
*   **Work In Progress:**
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Fixing Jest test assertions to match updated handler behavior (file paths vs. base64 strings).
        *   Investigating issue where the agent doesn't include image paths in responses.
        *   Troubleshooting small/corrupted image files (files in tmp/ being 18-21 bytes).
*   **Backlog/To-Do:**
    *   **Implementation Improvements:**
        *   Experiment with alternative return formats from handler (raw path, JSON, etc.)
        *   Add cleanup routine for tmp/ directory to prevent disk space issues
        *   Consider a more robust storage solution for persistent image storage
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Finalize `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
*   **Known Issues/Bugs:**
    *   **Critical**: Agent doesn't include image paths in responses, resulting in users not seeing image links
    *   **High**: Saved image files are very small (18-21 bytes) and appear corrupted when opened
    *   **Medium**: Jest tests fail due to new return format (expected base64, getting file paths)
    *   **Low**: No cleanup mechanism for tmp/ directory may lead to disk space issues
*   **Decision Log:**
    *   (2025-04-24) Decided to use `gpt-image-1` as the primary model.
    *   (2025-04-24) Initially planned to return base64 strings.
    *   (2025-04-24) Prioritized Generations and Edits endpoints; Variations (DALL-E 2 only) is lower priority.
    *   (2025-04-24) Completed initial memory bank documentation update before starting code.
    *   (2025-04-24) Changed strategy from returning base64 to saving image files due to token limits.
    *   (2025-04-24) Added `expected_response` to examples to teach the LLM to include image paths.
    *   Refer to `activeContext.md` for more granular recent decisions.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.1 - Initial Documentation & Planning Complete.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.2 - Basic Generation working.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.3 - Edits and Variations endpoints working.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.4 - CommonJS compatibility fixes applied.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.5 - Switched to file-based approach for token limit issue.
    *   **In Progress:** v0.6 - Fix agent response formatting issue.
    *   **Upcoming:** v0.9 - Testing complete.
    *   **Upcoming:** v1.0 - Skill Release Candidate.
