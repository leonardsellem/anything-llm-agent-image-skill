# Progress Tracker

*   **Completed Features:**
    *   Project brief defined and documented (`projectbrief.md`).
    *   Analysis of AnythingLLM skill development docs and OpenAI Image API docs completed.
    *   All memory bank files (`productContext.md`, `techContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) updated with initial project context and requirements (as of 2025-04-24).
    *   **Scaffolding:**
        *   Created skill directory (`openai-image-generation`).
        *   Created `plugin.json` with parameters, metadata, and examples.
        *   Created initial `handler.js` structure.
        *   Created `README.md`.
        *   Initialized `package.json` and installed dependencies.
        *   Set up Jest for testing.
    *   **Implementation:**
        *   Implemented OpenAI client initialization in `handler.js`.
        *   Implemented logic for `images.generate` endpoint.
        *   Implemented logic for `images.edit` endpoint (including mask handling).
        *   Implemented logic for `images.variation` endpoint.
        *   Implemented parameter validation.
        *   Implemented error handling and formatting.
        *   Converted `handler.js` to CommonJS module (per AnythingLLM requirements).
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Written unit tests for `handler.js` (mocking OpenAI calls).
*   **Work In Progress:**
    *   **Testing:**
        *   Fixing Jest test assertions to match updated handler error messages.
        *   Perform integration testing within a running AnythingLLM instance.
*   **Backlog/To-Do:**
    *   **Documentation:**
        *   Finalize `README.md` with setup and usage instructions.
*   **Known Issues/Bugs:**
    *   None identified yet.
*   **Decision Log:**
    *   (2025-04-24) Decided to use `gpt-image-1` as the primary model.
    *   (2025-04-24) Confirmed image return format will be base64 string.
    *   (2025-04-24) Prioritized Generations and Edits endpoints; Variations (DALL-E 2 only) is lower priority.
    *   (2025-04-24) Completed initial memory bank documentation update before starting code.
    *   Refer to `activeContext.md` for more granular recent decisions.
*   **Milestones:**
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.1 - Initial Documentation & Planning Complete.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.2 - Basic Generation working.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.3 - Edits and Variations endpoints working.
    *   **Achieved (2025-04-24):** v0.4 - CommonJS compatibility fixes applied.
    *   **In Progress:** v0.9 - Testing complete.
    *   **Upcoming:** v1.0 - Skill Release Candidate.
